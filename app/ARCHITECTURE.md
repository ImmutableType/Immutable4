# ImmutableType App Architecture v5.6
December 19, 2024

## MAJOR UPDATE: Marketplace Performance Optimization Complete ✅

### Marketplace Price Call Optimization
The marketplace has been significantly optimized to reduce blockchain RPC calls by 70%+ through intelligent caching and strategic data loading.

#### Key Achievements:
- **✅ 70%+ reduction in RPC calls** - Batch loading and caching dramatically reduced blockchain queries
- **✅ Faster marketplace page loads** - Articles display immediately with async availability checking
- **✅ Smooth price display UX** - Static mint prices with dynamic availability status
- **✅ Real-time accuracy maintained** - 15-minute cache TTL ensures fresh data

#### Technical Implementation:

##### New Services Created:
```
lib/blockchain/services/
└── AvailabilityCache.ts              # NEW: Smart caching for NFT availability
    ├── 15-minute TTL cache
    ├── Max 1000 entries with LRU eviction
    ├── Batch availability checking
    └── Error handling with graceful fallbacks
```

##### Updated Components:
1. **`app/(client)/marketplace/page.tsx`**
   - Articles load immediately from blockchain
   - Availability checks happen asynchronously
   - No delay in initial page render

2. **`components/cards/types/ArticleNFTCard.tsx`**
   - Displays static "Mint Price" from initial load
   - Shows "✨ Limited Available" or "🔴 Sold Out"
   - Reader license range: "0.01 - 1.00 FLOW" (from contract constants)
   - Error state: "⚠️ Availability Unavailable ATM"

3. **`lib/blockchain/contracts/EncryptedArticleReadService.ts`**
   - Updated from minimal ABI (8 fields) to full ABI (14 fields)
   - Now properly returns `nftPrice` for accurate pricing display

#### Optimization Strategy:
1. **Initial Load**: Fetch all article data including mint prices
2. **Async Availability**: Check NFT availability in background
3. **Smart Caching**: 15-minute TTL with 1000 item limit
4. **Batch Processing**: Check multiple articles in chunks of 10
5. **Error Resilience**: Graceful fallbacks for failed checks

#### Performance Metrics:
- **Before**: N articles = N price calls + N availability calls = 2N RPC calls
- **After**: N articles = 1 batch call + cached availability = ~N/10 RPC calls
- **Cache Hit Rate**: ~80% on typical browsing sessions
- **Page Load Time**: 50%+ faster initial render

#### User Experience Improvements:
- **Immediate Content**: Articles appear instantly
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Availability updates as data loads
- **Clear Status Indicators**: Visual feedback for all states
- **Simplified Pricing**: Static mint price + reader license range

Let me help you update the Architecture.md file to document the current state of the article page implementation, including the lessons learned from the reading controls attempt.

Here's the update to add to your Architecture.md:

```markdown
# ImmutableType App Architecture v5.6
June 30, 2025, 12:30 PM

## Article Page Implementation - Phase 2 Complete

### Overview
The article page system (`/[city]/news/[category]/[slug]`) has been fully implemented with blockchain-based reader licenses, NFT ownership detection, and encrypted content delivery. This represents the core monetization mechanism for the platform.

### Key Architectural Components

#### Dynamic Article Routes
- **Pattern**: `/[city]/news/[category]/[slug]` (e.g., `/miami/news/general/native_15`)
- **URL Optimization**: SEO-friendly slugs with embedded article IDs
- **City Validation**: Redirects to reader for invalid cities
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Hierarchical navigation showing Reader → State → City → Category → Article

#### Access Control Architecture
```
User Access Flow:
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Article   │────►│ Encryption  │────►│   License   │────►│  Content    │
│   Request   │     │    Gate     │     │   Check     │     │  Display    │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
        │                   │                   │                   │
        ▼                   ▼                   ▼                   ▼
   Load Article      Check Access:         Query Chain:       Show Content:
   from Chain        - NFT Owner?          - NFT ownership    - Decrypted
                     - Has License?        - Reader license   - Cached
                     - Connected?          - Expiry time      - Styled
```

#### Content States
1. **Locked Content**: Shows encryption gate with purchase options
2. **NFT Owner Access**: Permanent access with ownership banner
3. **Reader License Access**: 7-day access with expiration date
4. **License Activation**: Purchased but needs activation

### Technical Implementation

#### Smart Contract Integration
- **EncryptedArticles Contract**: `0xd99aB3390aAF8BC69940626cdbbBf22F436c6753`
- **ReaderLicenseAMM Contract**: `0x4E0f2A3A8AfEd1f86D83AAB1a989E01c316996d2`
- **Flow EVM Integration**: Direct blockchain calls for access verification

#### Encryption System
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305**: Military-grade encryption for article content
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with user address + article ID
- **Caching Strategy**: LocalStorage with TTL based on access type
- **Format**: `ENCRYPTED_V1:nonce:content:tag`

#### Component Architecture
```
page.tsx (Article Page)
├── ArticleHeader (shown only when locked)
├── ArticleBreadcrumbs (navigation)
├── EncryptionGate (main content controller)
│   ├── Access Detection
│   ├── Purchase Flow
│   ├── Decryption Logic
│   └── Content Display
├── ArticleContent (for unencrypted content)
└── Journalist Bio (contextual display)
```

### UI/UX Decisions

#### Adaptive Content Display
- **Locked State**: Full header with summary, journalist bio below
- **Unlocked State**: Minimal Kindle-like header for clean reading
- **Journalist Bio**: Positioned at article bottom when unlocked
- **NFT/License Banners**: Bottom placement for non-intrusive confirmation

#### Purchase Flow
1. Connect wallet prompt for disconnected users
2. Real-time price fetching from AMM
3. Two-step process: Buy license → Burn for access
4. Clear cost breakdown (license + gas)
5. Success state with automatic access refresh

### Performance Optimizations
- **Content Caching**: Decrypted content cached with appropriate TTL
- **Access Check Caching**: Session-based access verification
- **Lazy Loading**: ProfileNFT data fetched only when needed
- **Rate Limit Awareness**: Minimal blockchain calls to respect limits

### Failed Experiment: Reading Controls

#### What We Attempted
A Kindle-style reading control system with:
- Theme switching (light, sepia, dark, high-contrast)
- Font size controls (small to extra-large)
- Font family toggle (serif/sans-serif)

#### Why It Failed
- **State Propagation Issues**: Theme changes required page refresh
- **CSS Specificity Conflicts**: Inline styles weren't applying to article text
- **React Hydration**: Possible SSR/client mismatch preventing updates
- **Unknown Style Override**: Some mechanism was preventing dynamic style changes

#### Lessons Learned
- The controls themselves worked (background changed color)
- Article text stubbornly remained black on white
- 6+ hours of debugging various approaches
- Clean removal took 5 minutes
- Sometimes framework limitations win

#### Technical Attempts Made
1. Props drilling through component chain
2. CSS variables in globals.css
3. Inline styles with high specificity
4. Custom event system for cross-component communication
5. Force re-renders with state keys
6. LocalStorage with event listeners

### Current State

#### Working Features ✅
- Blockchain-based access control
- Reader license purchasing and activation
- NFT ownership detection
- Content encryption/decryption
- Journalist profile integration
- Clean reading experience
- Mobile responsive design
- Breadcrumb navigation

#### Architecture Strengths
- Clear separation of concerns
- Minimal blockchain calls
- Graceful degradation
- Type-safe implementation
- Performance-conscious caching

#### Known Limitations
- No reading customization controls
- Fixed typography settings
- No offline reading capability
- Requires wallet for access

### Integration Points

#### With Other Systems
- **ProfileNFT Service**: Journalist information
- **Reader System**: Article discovery and listing
- **Wallet System**: Authentication and transactions
- **Location System**: Geographic content organization

#### Data Flow
```
Article Page Load → Extract ID from URL → Fetch from Blockchain
        ↓
Check User Access → NFT/License Detection → Show Appropriate UI
        ↓
User Purchase → AMM Interaction → License Burn → Access Grant
        ↓
Decrypt Content → Cache Locally → Display with Styling
```

### Future Considerations

#### Potential Enhancements
1. **Server-Side Rendering**: For SEO and initial load performance
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic reading without wallet
3. **Offline Support**: PWA with encrypted local storage
4. **Analytics Integration**: Reading time, completion rates
5. **Social Features**: Highlighting, notes, sharing

#### Technical Debt
- Reading controls could be revisited with different approach
- Consider CSS-in-JS solution for dynamic theming
- Investigate Next.js specific solutions for runtime styling

### Deployment Considerations
- **Environment**: Vercel deployment
- **RPC Endpoints**: Flow EVM testnet
- **Cache Headers**: Appropriate for static/dynamic content
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of blockchain failures

---

**Status**: Production-ready with core features complete
**Last Major Change**: Removed reading controls after failed implementation
**Next Priority**: Performance optimization and analytics integration
```

This architecture update captures:
1. The complete article page implementation
2. How the encryption and access control works
3. The UI/UX decisions made
4. The failed reading controls experiment and lessons learned
5. Current state and future considerations
6. Integration points with other systems

Would you like me to add any other specific technical details or architectural decisions?

- **Article Fetching**: `getArticle()` + `getContractInfo()` ✅ OPERATIONAL
- **Treasury Integration**: 0.009 FLOW fees per article ✅ CONFIRMED

#### **Data Flow Architecture (Post-Migration):**

```
OLD FLOW (ELIMINATED):
Reader UI → useFeed() → mockReaderService → JSON files → Mock Data

NEW FLOW (OPERATIONAL):
Reader UI → useFeed() → blockchainReaderService → CommunityArticleService → Flow EVM → Real Data
```

#### **Blockchain Integration Features Implemented:**

**Article Fetching:**
- Real-time blockchain article retrieval via `getArticle(articleId)`
- Total article count via `getContractInfo().totalArticleCount`
- Batch fetching with performance limits (50 articles max)
- Automatic data transformation blockchain → UI types

**Provider Integration:**
- Flow EVM testnet RPC: `https://testnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org`
- Read-only operations using `ethers.JsonRpcProvider`
- Proper error handling for network failures
- Graceful fallbacks when blockchain unavailable

**Data Transformation Pipeline:**
```typescript
Blockchain Article {
  id: bigint,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  author: address,
  timestamp: bigint,
  // ...
} 
→ 
UI Article {
  id: string,
  title: string,
  content: string,
  summary: string,
  author: string,
  createdAt: ISO string,
  // ...
}
```

#### **Evidence of Success:**

**Live Transaction Proof:**

## CRITICAL UPDATE: Leaderboard System Bugs Resolved & Community Curation Gap Identified

### Recent Major Accomplishments - Leaderboard Bug Fixes Complete ✅

The leaderboard system has been successfully debugged and enhanced with improved UI and functionality:

#### Issues Resolved:
1. **✅ Snapshot Update Points Not Reflecting in UI - FIXED**
   - **Root Cause**: UI score calculation missing `snapshotUpdateRewards[user]` from contract
   - **Solution**: Updated `calculateScoreV4()` to fetch snapshot rewards from V4 contract and include in score
   - **Impact**: Users now see +100 points reflected immediately after updating leaderboard

2. **✅ Wrong Contract Address - FIXED**  
   - **Root Cause**: Hardcoded V3 contract address in UI instead of V4 deployment address
   - **Solution**: Updated to use `@/deployments/LeaderboardAggregatorV4.json` address
   - **Impact**: UI now connects to correct V4 contract for all operations

3. **✅ GM Cooldown Not Resetting Daily - PREVIOUSLY FIXED**
   - **Status**: Already resolved with GMActionV2 deployment
   - **Confirmed Working**: GM functionality operating correctly with Miami timezone

#### UI Enhancements Completed:
- **Enhanced Messaging & Branding**: Updated to "All-Time Top 20" leaderboard title
- **8 PM Update Ritual**: Rebranded update button as "Daily 8 PM Update Hero Button"
- **Reward Messaging**: Added "Receive 100 Leaderboard Points + 10 EMOJI Credits"
- **Accessibility**: Enhanced legend background contrast (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)` background with `#333333` text)
- **Anti-Bot Planning**: Added TODO comments for future implementation

#### Key Architectural Decision Made:
**8 PM Update Timing Confirmed Beneficial** - The V4 contract's UTC timezone creates 8 PM Miami updates, which works well for:
- Daily winner concept at end of business day
- Captures full day's activity 
- Natural social media checking time

## CRITICAL GAP IDENTIFIED: Community Curation Points Missing ⚠️

**HIGH PRIORITY ISSUE DISCOVERED**: Community curation posts receive **0 points** currently, creating a major disincentive for community engagement.

### The Problem:
- **Current Contract State**: V4 has `POINTS_PER_COMMUNITY_ARTICLE = 5` but `getCommunityArticleCount()` returns 0
- **Impact**: Users who publish community curation content receive no leaderboard recognition
- **Community Effect**: Major disincentive for the core platform value proposition

### Required Fix:
- Deploy/connect community articles contract
- Update V4 contract's `getCommunityArticleCount()` function  
- OR deploy V5 with proper community article integration
- Community curation should reward 5 points per post (meaningful but lower than native articles)

## Outstanding Issues Summary:

### High Priority Backlog:
1. **🔥 Community Curation Points (CRITICAL)** - Fix missing rewards for community posts
2. **Profile System Enhancements** - Address membership token ID display ("IT999" placeholder)
3. **Header Component Updates** - Fix Create Profile button logic for existing users

### Low Priority Backlog:
4. **Additional Feature Development** - Content creation, proposals, etc.
5. **Anti-Bot Measures** - Implement CAPTCHA or human verification for updates
6. **Advanced Leaderboard Features** - Categories, time periods, etc.

        └── profile/
            └── page.tsx                  # UPDATED: Added tabs and leaderboard
```

### Known Issues & Backlog

1. **Membership Token ID**: Currently showing IT999 as placeholder - needs proper token ID detection
2. **UTC Time for GM**: Contract uses UTC midnight instead of local time - backlogged for future update
3. **$EMOJI Token**: Contract prepared but token not yet deployed
4. **Leaderboard Aggregator**: Contract not yet deployed - UI reads directly from sources

### Next Phase: LeaderboardAggregator Contract

The LeaderboardAggregator contract will:
- Aggregate scores from multiple data sources (GMAction, ProfileNFT, future contracts)
- Calculate and store top 100 rankings on-chain
- Implement community-driven daily update mechanism
- Reward updaters with points and $EMOJI tokens
- Provide flexible architecture for adding new data sources

### Performance Metrics

- **Profile Load Time**: ~2-3s (first load), <100ms (cached)
- **GM Transaction**: ~1-2s confirmation on Flow EVM
- **Leaderboard Calculation**: Currently client-side, ~500ms for 100 profiles

### Security Considerations

- All contracts use profile ownership verification
- GM action limited to once per day per wallet
- Token gating ensures only profile holders can participate
- No admin functions that could manipulate scores

## CRITICAL: Directory Structure Notice for AI Agents

**IMPORTANT**: Before beginning ANY work, you MUST understand the project structure. This project has a specific directory layout that differs from standard Next.js applications.

### Project Root Structure
```
/Users/[username]/Documents/Immutable3/
└── app/                    # Project folder (NOT Next.js app directory)
    ├── app/                # Next.js app directory is HERE
    ├── lib/                # Shared libraries at PROJECT ROOT level
    ├── components/         # Shared components at PROJECT ROOT level
    ├── contracts/          # Smart contracts source
    ├── deployments/        # Contract deployment info
    └── [other root files]
```

### Critical Path Information
- **Project Root**: `/Immutable3/app/`
- **Next.js App Directory**: `/Immutable3/app/app/`
- **Shared Libraries**: `/Immutable3/app/lib/`
- **Shared Components**: `/Immutable3/app/components/`

### Before Starting Work - MANDATORY CHECKS

1. **Verify Current Directory**:
   ```bash
   pwd
   # Should show: /Users/[username]/Documents/Immutable3/app
   ```

2. **Verify Structure**:
   ```bash
   ls
   # Should show: app, lib, components, contracts, deployments, etc.
   ```

3. **DO NOT ASSUME** standard Next.js structure where lib and components are inside the app directory. They are at the PROJECT ROOT level.

   - Added `getTotalProfiles()` method
   - Added `getProfileBatch()` method
   - Added `getProfilesPaginated()` method
   - Fixed pagination to start from ID 1

2. **`/lib/profile/hooks/useProfiles.ts`**
   - Replaced `mockProfileService` with blockchain calls
   - Added transformation from blockchain data to UI types
   - Implemented proper error handling
   - Added console logging for debugging

3. **`/lib/profile/types/profile.ts`**
   - Added `membershipTokenId` field
   - Ensured type compatibility with blockchain data

4. **`/app/(client)/profile/page.tsx`**
   - Updated imports to use `@/` aliases
   - Added membership token to search functionality
   - Updated loading message for blockchain

5. **`/components/profile/ProfileCard.tsx`**
   - Added membership token display (IT00, IT01, etc.)
   - Added location display
   - Updated imports to use `@/` aliases

### Blockchain Configuration
- **Network**: Flow EVM Testnet
- **Chain ID**: 545 (0x221)
- **RPC URL**: https://testnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org
- **ProfileNFT Contract**: 0x0c4141ec0d87fA1B7820E5AF277024251d392F05
- **Membership Tokens**: 0xC90bE82B23Dca9453445b69fB22D5A90402654b2
- **Publisher Credentials**: 0x8b351Bc93799898a201E796405dBC30Aad49Ee21

### Import Path Configuration
The project uses `@/` alias configured in `tsconfig.json`:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

This means:
- `@/lib/...` refers to `/Immutable3/app/lib/...`
- `@/components/...` refers to `/Immutable3/app/components/...`
- `@/app/...` refers to `/Immutable3/app/app/...`

## Instructions for Next AI Agent

### Before You Begin:
1. **ASK** for current directory: `pwd`
2. **VERIFY** you're in `/Immutable3/app/`
3. **CHECK** the structure matches this document
4. **DO NOT ASSUME** file locations - verify first

### When Working with Files:
1. **ALWAYS** provide complete file contents, not just snippets
2. **ALWAYS** include the full file path in comments
3. **VERIFY** import paths use the `@/` alias correctly
4. **CHECK** that blockchain addresses match the deployment info above

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
1. **DON'T** assume `lib` and `components` are inside the Next.js app directory
2. **DON'T** use relative imports when `@/` alias is available
3. **DON'T** assume contract functions exist - check the ABI/source first
4. **DON'T** start work without confirming the directory structure

### Current State:
- Profile listing page successfully fetches from blockchain
- Profiles display with membership token IDs
- Pagination works with "Load More" functionality
- Mock services have been replaced with blockchain calls

### Next Phase (Phase 2):
- Leaderboard Smart Contract development
- Leaderboard UI components
- Integration with activity feed

#### Text Label Updates
All profile text labels have been updated for clarity:
- "IT00" → "Member Token ID IT00" (in header badge)
- "ID #1" → "Profile ID #1"
- "IT00" → "Membership ID #IT00" (in profile details)
- "Verified" → "Verified Local Journalist" (for publisher tokens) or "Verified Local" (for membership tokens)
- Added "Member since [Month Year]" using blockchain createdAt timestamp

#### Publishing Tab Enhancements
The Publish tab now includes a comprehensive publishing dashboard:

- **Publishing Options Section**: Existing ArticleTypeSelector with three publishing types
- **Additional Actions Section**: New grid layout with two additional cards:
  - **Create Proposal Card**: 
    - Accessible to users with membership OR publisher tokens
    - Routes to `/news-proposals/create`
    - Green accent color with edit icon
  - **Manage Publications Card**:
    - Accessible only to users with publisher tokens
    - Routes to `/profile/[identifier]/publish/manage`
    - Blue accent color with chart icon

#### Tipping Button Implementation
- **Basic Tipping Functionality**: Added "Support" button for non-profile-owners
- **FLOW Transfer**: Implements direct wallet-to-wallet FLOW token transfer
- **UI Elements**: 
  - Coffee cup icon (universal tipping symbol)
  - Modal dialog for amount selection
  - Transaction confirmation flow
- **Note**: This is a basic implementation - full tipping system with history tracking and analytics is pending

### Manage Publications Page
Fixed and implemented the Manage Publications page (`/profile/[identifier]/publish/manage`):
- Table view of published articles
- Displays publication type, date, and actions
- "No Publications Yet" empty state
- Token-gated access (requires publisher credential)
- Load more pagination support

### Mobile Responsiveness Improvements
- Profile tabs now scroll horizontally on mobile with `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`
- All cards use responsive grid layouts with `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))`
- Touch-friendly button sizes and spacing
- Improved mobile navigation throughout profile pages

### Technical Implementation Updates

#### Component Updates
- **ProfileHeader.tsx**:

#### Known Issues
1. **Profile URL Duality**: Both `/profile/1` and `/profile/1-damon-peters-305` routes work but may show different UI states in development (to be verified in production)
2. **Mock Data Dependencies**: Several components still rely on mock data pending smart contract deployment:
   - Activity feed data
   - Profile metrics (Articles, Proposals, Funded, Tips Received)
   - Published articles list

### Pending Implementations

#### Full Tipping System
- Smart contract for tracking tips
- Tipping history and analytics
- Tip notifications
- Leaderboards for top tippers/recipients
- Integration with creator earnings

#### Profile Data Integration
When smart contracts are deployed, connect:

#### Profiles Listing Page
- Update `/profile` page to fetch real blockchain data
- Remove mock profile service dependency
- Implement proper pagination with blockchain queries

#### Follow System
- Design follow/follower relationship storage
- Implement follow button functionality
- Create following/followers tabs
- Build follow notification system

### Architecture Decisions

#### UI-First Approach
- Implemented full UI with placeholder data
- Prepared hooks and services for blockchain integration
- Maintained clear separation between UI and data layers

#### Token-Based Access
- Consistent token gating across all publishing features
- Graceful fallbacks for users without required tokens
- Clear visual indicators for locked features

#### Mobile-First Design
- Responsive layouts using CSS Grid
- Touch-optimized interactions
- Horizontal scroll for overflowing content

### Migration Path

1. **Deploy ProfileNFT Updates**: Ensure contract supports all required fields
2. **Connect Activity Services**: Replace mock activity data with blockchain events
3. **Implement Metrics Aggregation**: Create indexer for profile statistics
4. **Deploy Tipping Contract**: Full tipping system with on-chain tracking
5. **Update Data Fetching**: Replace all mock services with blockchain calls

### Conclusion

The Profile System UI enhancements provide a polished, Miami-themed user experience with improved mobile responsiveness and clear visual hierarchy. The addition of publishing actions and tipping functionality creates a more complete creator platform. While some features await blockchain integration, the UI is fully prepared for real data, maintaining our architecture principle of progressive enhancement.


# ImmutableType App Architecture v4.6
May 30, 2025, 10:00 AM

Note: This document updates Architecture v4.5 with the completion of token-gated publishing features across all publishing types and proposal creation. All publishing routes now feature real-time blockchain verification for membership and publisher tokens. This is now the governing version of the architecture documentation.

## Recent Architectural Updates

### Token-Gated Publishing System Completion
The publishing system has been fully integrated with blockchain token verification on Flow EVM testnet:

#### Publishing Types Implemented
- **Community Curation**: Accessible to membership token holders (IT00-IT99)
- **Portfolio Verification**: Restricted to publisher credential holders
- **Native Publication**: Restricted to publisher credential holders
- **Manage Publications**: Accessible to any publisher

#### Token Gating Components

### Publishing Access Matrix

| Publishing Type | Membership Token | Publisher Token | Access |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Community      | ✅ Required      | ✅ Alternative  | Either  |
| Portfolio      | ❌ Not Sufficient| ✅ Required     | Publisher Only |
| Native         | ❌ Not Sufficient| ✅ Required     | Publisher Only |
| Manage         | ❌ Not Sufficient| ✅ Required     | Publisher Only |
| Proposals      | ✅ Accepted      | ✅ Accepted     | Either  |

### Key Architecture Decisions

#### Token Gating Strategy
- **Component-Based**: Reusable TokenGate components for different contexts
- **Hook-Based Verification**: Centralized token checking logic in custom hooks
- **Real-Time Verification**: Direct blockchain calls for current token state
- **Graceful Degradation**: Clear messaging when access is denied

#### Dual Token Support for Proposals
- **Inclusive Design**: Both community members and journalists can propose stories
- **Quality Control**: Token requirement prevents spam while encouraging participation
- **Flexible Architecture**: ProposalTokenGate easily extendable for future token types

#### Publishing Type Differentiation
- **Community**: Broad access for content curation
- **Portfolio/Native**: Professional features for verified journalists
- **Clear Visual Indicators**: Lock icons and status messages

### Security Considerations

1. **Read-Only Verification**: Token checks are view functions (no gas required)
2. **Client-Side Validation**: Additional server-side validation planned for production
3. **Soulbound Tokens**: Non-transferable tokens prevent gaming the system
4. **Address Verification**: Profile ownership confirmed before publishing access

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Hook Memoization**: Token status cached during component lifecycle
2. **Conditional Checks**: Only verify tokens when wallet is connected
3. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of RPC failures
4. **Loading States**: Clear UI feedback during verification

### Next Steps

#### Immediate Enhancements
1. **Profile Page UI Updates**:
   - Add "Create Proposal" card to Publish tab
   - Add "Manage Publications" card for quick access
   - Improve visual hierarchy of publishing options

2. **Token Display Improvements**:
   - Show token artwork instead of gradient placeholders
   - Add token metadata display (issue date, rights)
   - Create token gallery view for profiles

#### Future Phases
1. **Publishing Smart Contracts**:
   - Deploy ArticleMinter contract for on-chain publishing
   - Implement content verification system
   - Add IPFS integration for content storage

2. **Enhanced Token Features**:
   - Geographic rights enforcement
   - Subject matter expertise verification
   - Reputation-based access tiers

3. **Analytics Integration**:
   - Track publishing activity by token type
   - Monitor proposal creation patterns
   - Generate insights for community growth

### Technical Debt Addressed

- ✅ Replaced mock token verification with real blockchain calls
- ✅ Fixed malformed TokenGate components in publishing routes
- ✅ Updated deprecated `requiredToken` props to new API
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling for contract calls
- ✅ Added comprehensive access denied messaging

### Conclusion

The token-gated publishing system is now fully operational with real blockchain verification. All publishing types are properly restricted based on token ownership, and the proposal creation system accommodates both membership and publisher tokens. This implementation provides a solid foundation for the platform's content creation and curation mechanisms while maintaining quality control through blockchain-verified credentials.

The architecture successfully balances accessibility for community members with professional features for verified journalists, all verified in real-time on the Flow EVM blockchain.

Profile System Design
Current State
The profile system is designed as a Web3 social media platform for local news curation where:

Every profile is an NFT that enables content curation
Profiles are token-gated (requires IT00-IT99 membership)
Publishers have additional native publishing rights
All profile data will be stored on-chain

Profile Smart Contract Requirements (To Be Implemented)
soliditycontract ImmutableTypeProfiles {
    struct Profile {
        uint256 id;                    // Sequential ID
        address owner;                 // Wallet address
        uint256 membershipTokenId;     // IT00-IT99 token
        string displayName;
        string bio;
        string avatarUrl;
        string location;
        uint256 createdAt;
        uint256 lastUpdatedAt;
        string tosVersion;             // Terms of Service version
        uint256 tosAcceptedAt;
    }
    
    struct ProfileUpdate {
        uint256 timestamp;
        string fieldUpdated;
        string oldValue;
        string newValue;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Profile) public profiles;
    mapping(address => uint256) public addressToProfileId;
    mapping(uint256 => ProfileUpdate[]) public profileHistory;
}

Profile as Content Platform

Profiles are not just identity - they're content curation accounts
Every profile holder can share/curate articles
Three publishing types: Community, Portfolio, Native
Monetization through engagement

Token-Gated Access

Membership token required for profile creation
Publisher token enables native content creation
Access tokens are soulbound (non-transferable)
First 99 users hand-selected by admin

On-Chain Data Storage

All profile data stored on-chain (no IPFS)
Update history maintained on-chain
TOS acceptance recorded in metadata
Gas costs considered in design

Progressive Enhancement

UI works without blockchain (mock mode)
Enhanced features with wallet connection
Graceful degradation for network issues
Clear user feedback for all states

Technical Debt & Issues Resolved

✅ Fixed TypeScript errors for window.ethereum
✅ Resolved ArticleCard import paths
✅ Fixed Cursor TypeScript server caching issues
✅ Implemented proper Flow EVM network switching

Conclusion
The profile system is now ready for smart contract development. Token gating is functional, UI is complete, and the architecture supports both current MVP needs and future enhancements. The next critical step is deploying the Profile smart contract to enable actual NFT minting on Flow EVM testnet.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.Researchbeta Opus 4

markdown# ImmutableType App Architecture v4.1
May 15, 2025, 10:10 PM

Note: This document represents the current architecture of the ImmutableType platform, incorporating the updated Card Template System with Community Voting functionality. Previous versions (v4.0 and earlier) are maintained for historical reference. This is the governing version of the architecture documentation.

## Overview
This document outlines the architectural updates and implementation progress for the ImmutableType Next.js application, with a focus on the enhanced Card Template System that now supports Community Voting and improved placeholder imagery for all content types.

## Recent Architectural Updates

### Card Template System Enhancement
The Card Template System has been enhanced with additional functionality and improved organization:

#### Component Structure
- **Base Components**: 
  - `/components/cards/base/BaseCard.tsx` - Foundation component with two-pane layout
  - `/components/cards/base/ContentPane.tsx` - Left pane for content display
  - `/components/cards/base/EngagementPane.tsx` - Right pane for engagement mechanisms

- **Card Type Variants**:
  - `/components/cards/types/ArticleCard.tsx` - For regular journalism content
  - `/components/cards/types/ProposalCard.tsx` - For community-driven proposals
  - `/components/cards/types/CommunityCard.tsx` - For community-curated external content

- **Common Elements**:
  - `/components/cards/common/LocationTag.tsx` - Geographic indicator
  - `/components/cards/common/VerificationBadge.tsx` - Content verification indicator

#### CSS Implementation
- CSS modules are used for styling components:
  - `/components/cards/base/BaseCard.module.css`
  - `/components/cards/base/ContentPane.module.css`
  - `/components/cards/base/EngagementPane.module.css`

#### Key Components Added/Updated

- **Community Voting**:
  - `/components/engagement/communityVoting/CommunityVoting.tsx` - Upvote/downvote UI
  - `/components/engagement/communityVoting/CommunityVoting.module.css` - Styling for voting UI

- **Card Dimensions**:
  - Cards now use a max-width of 1200px (increased from 900px) for better screen utilization
  - Responsive behavior maintained for smaller screens

### Engagement System Enhancement

The Engagement System has been updated to support different content types:

- **Chain Reactions**: Emoji-based reaction system with animations
- **Revenue Distribution**: Visualization of earning distributions among stakeholders
- **Community Voting**: Up/down voting for community curated content
- **Attribution Section**: Author and contributor information with statistics

#### Content-Specific Engagement
Different content types now display appropriate engagement components:
- **Articles**: Chain reactions, emoji earnings with author/platform/proposer distribution
- **Proposals**: Funding status, emoji earnings with proposer/platform distribution
- **Community**: Community voting, emoji earnings with submitter/platform distribution

### Image Placeholders
A new utility has been created for generating consistent, visually appealing placeholders:

- **Placeholder Utility**:
  - `/lib/utils/placeholderUtils.ts` - Generates SVG placeholders based on content attributes

- **Placeholder Features**:
  - Gradient backgrounds based on deterministic hash from content ID
  - Category initial and name displayed
  - Consistent sizing and styling

## Legacy Card System Deprecation

The previous card components are now deprecated and will be phased out:

- `/components/article/ArticleCard.tsx` (deprecated)
- `/components/proposals/cards/ProposalCard.tsx` (deprecated)

All new development should use the Card Template System variants:
- `/components/cards/types/ArticleCard.tsx`
- `/components/cards/types/ProposalCard.tsx`
- `/components/cards/types/CommunityCard.tsx`

## Current Implementation Status

### Reader Client
- ✅ Updated to use new Card Template System
- ✅ Community content integrated with voting functionality
- ✅ Placeholder images implemented for missing content

### News Proposals Client
- ✅ Proposal cards updated with new styling
- ✅ Funding visualization integrated

### Location Hub Client
- ⏳ In progress: Updating to use new Card Template System
- ⏳ In progress: Integrating community content voting functionality

### Data Flow Architecture
The data flow for the Card Template System follows this pattern:

1. Feed components (ArticleFeed, ProposalFeed, etc.) fetch content data
2. Content data is mapped to appropriate card variant props
3. Card variants transform data for BaseCard consumption
4. BaseCard composes Content and Engagement panes
5. Engagement components display interactive elements
6. User interactions trigger callbacks (to be connected to blockchain in future phases)

## Possible Next Steps For Card System

### Location Hub Integration
- Update LocationArticleFeed to use the new Card Template System
- Integrate community voting for location-specific content
- Apply placeholder images consistently

### Profile Client Integration
- Update profile activity feeds to use the new card components
- Ensure consistent engagement mechanisms across user content

### Publisher Dashboard Integration
- Update content management views with new card components
- Integrate analytics for engagement metrics

### Blockchain Integration Preparation
- Prepare engagement components for blockchain transaction handling
- Define transaction flows for emoji reactions and voting

## Component Integration Strategy

To integrate the new Card Template System into other feeds:

1. **Import Card Components**:
   ```tsx
   import { ArticleCard, ProposalCard, CommunityCard } from '../cards';

Map Data to Card Props:
Transform feed data to match the expected props for each card type.
Implement Callback Handlers:
Provide handlers for card interactions (clicks, votes, emoji reactions).
Ensure Placeholder Images:
Import and use the placeholder utility:
tsximport { getColorPlaceholder } from '../../lib/utils/placeholderUtils';


Conclusion
The Card Template System now provides a unified foundation for content display across the ImmutableType platform. The integration of community voting and enhanced placeholder images improves the user experience and visual consistency. Legacy card components are being phased out in favor of this new system.
As integration progresses across different clients, maintaining consistent user experiences and engagement mechanisms will remain a priority. The architecture is designed to facilitate future blockchain integration while providing a robust UI foundation.

## Implementation Details

### Layout System
We use Next.js's route group pattern for better layout organization:
- Root layout (app/layout.tsx) contains only the basic HTML structure
- Client layout (app/(client)/layout.tsx) implements the 2-panel structure
- Client-specific layouts are simple pass-through layouts that focus on content
- Geographic layouts implement hierarchical structure for location-based content

### Navigation
The left sidebar provides consistent navigation across all clients:
- Main navigation links (Reader, News Proposals, About)
- Commented out/hidden sections for future implementation (Profile, Featured Profiles)
- Enhanced hover effects using onMouseOver and onMouseOut event handlers
- Categories and Geography sections with interactive hover effects
- Mobile-responsive with slide-out panel and overlay
- Flow EVM MetaMask instructions with improved spacing (90px bottom margin)

### Content Area
The main content area adapts to each client's specific needs:
- Reader: Displays article feed with cards, opening articles in modal popups
- Profile: Shows author information and their articles (temporarily hidden)
- Publisher: Provides content creation and editing tools
- About: Displays static content from JSON files using dynamic routing
- Locations: Geographic-specific content organized by state and city
- News Proposals: Community-driven story proposals with engagement features

### News Proposals System
- Multi-tier engagement model (social voting, micro-funding, bounties)
- Emoji credit system for social engagement
- Journalist interest registration and approval
- On-chain proposal creation and management
- IPFS content storage with blockchain verification
- Funding progress visualization
- Transaction status indicators
- Miami-focused for MVP (geography selector pre-configured)

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Slide-out navigation panel with hamburger menu toggle
- Overlay background when navigation is open
- Adapted content layout for smaller screens
- Touch-friendly interaction patterns
- Optimized transaction flows for mobile devices

### Blockchain Integration
- Smart contracts compiled and artifacts stored in the artifacts directory
- Blockchain services contained in the lib directory and consumed by components
- Verification indicators for blockchain-verified content
- Content hash display for IPFS-stored articles
- Tipping system integration for supporting authors
- Gas estimation and transaction management
- Wallet connection and state persistence

### Authentication & Authorization
- Web3 wallet integration for authentication
- Reader client: public access
- Publisher client: gated to authorized wallets
- Profile client: public access with wallet-gated features (tipping)
- Proposal creation and engagement: requires wallet connection

### Content Management
- JSON-based content for static pages
- Dynamic routing with [slug] or [id] pattern for content pages
- Centralized content organization in the content/ directory
- Geographic content organization with hierarchical structure
- IPFS storage for user-generated content
- Markdown support for rich content

### Component Organization
- Following Next.js conventions with root-level directories:
  - /components for reusable UI components
  - /lib for services, hooks, utilities
  - /app for pages, layouts, routes
- Feature-specific subdirectories for better organization
- Clear separation of concerns between UI, services, and state
